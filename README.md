## Who I Am

<img src="portfolio.jpg" align="left"> 
I am a student and healthcare worker with a passion for health, research, human-computer interaction, and computers. 

The most important thing in my life is improving myself and the daily lives of those around me, by means of education and encouragement. 

I pride myself on the energy and dedication I bring to each new project I take on, regardless of the field. 

An interesting thing about me is I love travelling, cats, and coffee!
